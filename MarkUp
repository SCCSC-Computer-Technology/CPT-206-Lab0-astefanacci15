I hope I've done all this right.
I really like this platform, but coming from someone who has never used anything like this, I'm struggling a bit.
Mostly with the terminology and what is corresponds too.
I also hope that we get a little more practice before bigger assignments and being in groups.
God forbid I delete someone's work.
